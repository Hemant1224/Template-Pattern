# Template-Pattern

The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. Here's a simple explanation in layman's terms:

What is the Template Design Pattern?
Imagine you are a chef who runs a cooking class. You have a standard recipe for making a dish, say a cake, but you allow your students to customize certain parts of the recipe, such as the flavor, filling, and toppings. The basic steps to make the cake (like mixing the batter, baking, and cooling) remain the same for everyone, but each student can decide on their own flavor and decorations.

Key Points:
1. Skeleton of an Algorithm: The Template Design Pattern defines the basic structure or skeleton of an algorithm in a method, called the template method.
2. Customizable Steps: Subclasses can override specific steps of the algorithm to provide custom behavior without altering the algorithm's structure.
3. Reuse and Maintainability: This pattern promotes code reuse and maintainability by separating the invariant parts of the algorithm from the parts that can vary.

Real-World Analogy:
Think of the template method as a master recipe for baking a cake. The master recipe provides the steps:

1. Gather ingredients.
2. Prepare the batter.
3. Bake the cake.
4. Cool the cake.
5. Decorate the cake.
 
 While the master recipe remains the same, each baker can customize the steps where they add flavors or decorations:

1. One baker might add vanilla flavor.
2. Another might add chocolate chips.
3. A third baker might decorate with strawberries.
